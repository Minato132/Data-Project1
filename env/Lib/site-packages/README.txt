This is a simple GitHub Repo that hosts, locally, a website to model and show statistics of 
the salaries of Software Developers. The website includes an explore page which will show graphical 
statistics of salaries, and a predict page that will predict salaries based on conditions.

The model was trained on data gathered from StackOverFlow 2020 Developer Survey.

The framework that the website is built off of is Streamlit. Streamlit allows local host capabilties, as well
as, built in HTML/CSS/Javascript conversions from code. 

In order to run the website locally, 
  Open the repo and open with any kind of IDE of your choice

  Above is a line #! <Directory>. Make sure to enter the location of the python.exe file that is in 
  the env folder. 

  Now activate the virtual environment in PowerShell using the activate script in the env folder

  Run the command streamlit run app.py, and windows should automatically redirect you to the website


Enjoy!
